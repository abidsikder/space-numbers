# Space Numbers

To compile the pdf for yourself, use `typst compile main.typ`. A pre-compiled one is also available in the repo for reading.

You can find more information about installing and using typst, a next generation LaTeX, here: https://github.com/typst/typst

The figures, "2d.png" and "3d.png" were created in Figma, but I have also included the SVGs here in the repo.
